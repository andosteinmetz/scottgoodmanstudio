        HOWTO

        1 • open Terminal app, and type the letters “cd” followed by a space
        2 • drag and drop the scottgoodmanstudio.com folder into the Terminal, and then hit ENTER
        3 • type "node app", and hit ENTER
        4 • navigate to http://localhost:3001/admin/ in a web browser

        Add Images:
        6 • drop full-size images into site/art/images/fullsize and thumbnails into site/art/images/thumbs
        7 • click ADD once you’ve added images into their folders

        Add Captions:
        8 • create a new plain text file (in Text Edit: Format > Make Plain Text), and save it with the same name as the image, but with the extension .md in the images/captions folder.
        9 • click "ADD"

        10 • click SAVE
        11 • click BUILD
        12 • upload new images and revised index.html files via FTP. Alternately, you can re-upload the entire folders, but this will take longer to re-upload all of your images.
